# version without the v: x.y.z or x.y.z-pre, numbers without leading zeros, no empty pre-release identifier and no
# leading zero in a numeric one, and no +build metadata (Go ignores it in a version tag). The value reaches the check
# through the environment, so the shell does not parse it as code, and the line after it only runs for a plain version.
# That protects the shell lines only: make itself still expands $(...) in a VERSION from the command line, so the
# tag-name check of the release workflow is the real boundary there.
